# Portfolio Backend

This repository contains the backend of my ever evolving portfolio site so it can be hosted separetely. It may be the case that an entire express backend and database is overkill for a portfolio so this project exists to test that assersion and see if there are performance gains from hosting the front end on Netlify.

## Goals and Methods

 I created this project as an experiment to see if I could host the front end of the portfolio on Netlify for their always-on feature. It is also an experiment to attempt to answer the question, "when should I build a backend equipped with a database vs can I get away with values stored in a locally stored JSON"?
